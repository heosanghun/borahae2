[Intro]
Yeah we glow up
All together
(hey)
Worldwide hearts
Beat forever

[Verse 1]
Met you in a comment, late-night scrolling
Username shining, little blue glowing
Didn’t know your face but I knew your feeling
Typed three words, hit send, now I’m healing

You were there on the worst day, cheering
Typing “you got this”, eyes still tearing
Different time zones, same big ceiling
Same song up, same roof, same meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up to the screen like a skyline
We don’t need a road or a train line
You said “I’m here”
So I stayed here
Now my fears move back in the brake lights

[Chorus]
We a love army, stand in the front row
Purple in our veins, let the care grow (oh-oh)
Every single scar, every tired heartbeat
Marching side by side till our knees weak

We a love army, promise you got me
If you ever fall, land on this body
Strangers to family
Shouting in harmony
We, we, we are a love army

[Verse 2]
Lightstick on the shelf, but the flame still burning
Replay on the track, every night returning
You said “if you cry, then I cry too”
That’s how I knew I could trust you

From “are you okay?” to “I got your secret”
From late night laughs to “you helped me keep it”
We don’t share blood but we share that bruising
Turn all that pain into power we’re using

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up to the sky, that’s a headcount
Every little voice, yeah it all counts
You said “I’m scared”
I said “I’m scared”
Then we both found courage in the same sound

[Chorus]
We a love army, stand in the front row
Purple in our veins, let the care grow (oh-oh)
Every single scar, every tired heartbeat
Marching side by side till our knees weak

We a love army, promise you got me
If you ever fall, land on this body
Strangers to family
Shouting in harmony
We, we, we are a love army

[Bridge]
When the world gets loud, you can call my name (call my name)
I’ll be in your corner, taking on the blame (ooh yeah)
If they say you’re nothing, I’ll just laugh it off
’Cause I’ve seen you rising every time you’re lost

[Chorus]
We a love army, stand in the front row
Purple in our veins, let the care grow (oh-oh)
Every single scar, every tired heartbeat
Marching side by side till our knees weak

We a love army, promise you got me
If you ever fall, land on this body
Strangers to family
Shouting in harmony
We, we, we are a love army (yeah)
We, we, we are a love army
